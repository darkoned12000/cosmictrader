This is a web-based game based on the Yankee Trader and TradeWars 2002 BBS Doors games.

I will be trying to include a lot of the game features from both and combine them into a basic 
web based game. Right now its in early stages and I would like to get a single-player aspect completed
before adding any multiplayer aspect.

What I want in the game:
- Port Trading
- Sector navigation
- Events
- Planets
- Robbing/Stealing
- Combat
- Different ships
- Fighters/Mines/Missiles
- This will be a minimalistic game, so no heavy graphics and will try to capture the feel of the older games
- I am not an ASCII artist so I will do the best I can ;)
- A good saving mechanism while testing in single player mode
- More to come.....

Things I would like in the game but not sure if I can make it happen:
- Port-to-Port trading mechanism (like a script)
- Robbing players/npc
- Aliens/NPCs that will actively move on the map and perform actions while you play
- Will need a database for advanced mechanics
- After getting base game mechanics down and testing, figure out how to insert multiplayer

Things that will not be in the game:
- Scripting actions
