Roadmap for NPC redesign (live world)

Phase 1: NPC Basic Economy & Data Foundation (Starting Point)
The goal of this phase is to establish the fundamental economic capabilities for individual NPC ships.

Implement NPC Credits & Inventory:
Modify the Ship class (in ship-definitions.js) to include credits and inventory properties for each NPC ship.
Ensure createNpcShip initializes these new properties.
Update loadGame (in script.js) to correctly rehydrate these new properties when a game is loaded.
Simulate NPC Trading:
When an NPC ship enters a port or spacePort (within moveNPCs in modules/factions.js), implement basic AI logic.
NPCs will have a chance to buy or sell a random commodity based on their credits, inventory, available cargoSpace, and the port's prices/stock.
Update both the NPC's and the port's credits and inventory accordingly.
Simulate NPC Mining:
When an NPC ship enters a planet (within moveNPCs in modules/factions.js), implement basic AI logic.
NPCs will have a chance to "mine" a random resource from the planet's resources (e.g., ore, minerals).
Update the NPC's inventory and the planet's resources.
Phase 2: NPC Ship Maintenance & Self-Improvement
Once NPCs can earn credits and resources, this phase focuses on them using those funds to maintain and enhance their individual ships.

NPC Self-Repair:
When a damaged NPC ship is at a port or spacePort (within moveNPCs or a new NPC AI function), implement logic for them to spend their personal credits to repair their hull and shields.
Prioritize repairs if hull/shields are low.
NPC Self-Upgrade/Replenishment:
NPCs will use their personal credits to buy consumables like fuel, fighters, and missiles at space ports if their current stock is low.
Expand to Permanent Upgrades: Introduce logic for NPCs to purchase permanent upgrades like additional maxShields, maxHull, or maxCargoSpace if they have sufficient funds, using equipmentCosts from game-data.js. This directly addresses making individual NPC ships "more powerful."
Phase 3: Faction Taxation & Centralized Fleet Management
This phase elevates faction growth beyond just commissioning new ships, incorporating strategic fleet maintenance and development funded by their members.

Faction Taxation System:
Implement a mechanism (e.g., within processFactionIncomeAndBuilding or a new function) where a percentage of the credits earned by individual NPC ships (their members) is automatically "taxed" and added to their respective faction's central credits pool. This provides a more organic income source for factions.
Faction Strategic Spending:
Expand the faction AI (within processFactionAction or a new function) to make strategic decisions on how to spend their collected credits:
Fleet-wide Repairs: Spend faction funds to repair damaged ships across their entire fleet (e.g., allocate funds to repair the most damaged ships).
Fleet-wide Upgrades: Invest in upgrading multiple ships in their fleet (e.g., increase max capacities for a type of ship, or replenish consumables for many ships).
Commissioning New Ships: Continue to commission new ships, but now balancing this against the needs for repairs and upgrades of their existing fleet.
Phase 4: Faction-Specific Infrastructure & Equipment
This phase introduces specialized faction infrastructure to further differentiate their economic and military capabilities.

Faction-Specific Equipment Data:
Create separate equipment cost definitions (e.g., duranEquipmentCosts, vinariEquipmentCosts) in data/game-data.js to reflect their unique technologies and prices.
Faction-Specific Space Ports:
Modify initGame (in script.js) to generate some spacePort objects with specific faction ownership (Duran, Vinari). These ports would offer their faction's unique equipment.
Create new spacePortImages for Duran and Vinari to give them a distinct visual identity.
NPC AI Integration:
NPCs will prioritize seeking out their own faction's space ports for repairs and upgrades, as these would offer their specific equipment or better prices.
Neutral space ports would still offer general equipment.
