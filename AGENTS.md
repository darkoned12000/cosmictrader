# Cosmic Trader - Agent Guidelines

## Game Description

**Cosmic Trader** is a web-based space trading and combat game inspired by classic BBS door games like Yankee Trader and TradeWars 2002. Players navigate a vast galaxy spanning 5,000 sectors (50x100 grid) which is expandable, engaging in commerce, combat, exploration, and faction politics.

### Core Gameplay Features:
- **Trading System**: Buy/sell commodities at ports, manage cargo capacity, and profit from market fluctuations
- **Combat Mechanics**: Engage in ship-to-ship battles using fighters, missiles, mines, and shields
- **Exploration**: Discover planets, scan sectors for hazards and opportunities, deploy solar arrays for energy
- **Faction Dynamics**: Navigate relationships with three major factions (Traders, Duran, Vinari) and their territories
- **NPC Interactions**: Encounter and battle AI-controlled ships with different archetypes, automated trading behaviors, equipment upgrades, fuel management, and faction-specific strategic decision-making
- **Economic Events**: Experience dynamic market changes through booms, busts, strikes, and shortages
- **Port Ownership**: Capture and manage ports for trading advantages and strategic positioning
- **Banking System**: Deposit/withdraw credits with 1.5% daily interest, PIN security, and persistent account storage
- **NPC Economy**: NPCs actively trade commodities and exotic resources, upgrade equipment, manage fuel, and accumulate wealth through automated decision-making

### Technical Architecture:
- Built with vanilla JavaScript using ES6 modules
- Real-time performance monitoring and optimization tools
- Modular architecture separating core logic, UI, data, and feature modules
- Modular architecture separating core logic, UI, data, and feature modules
- Local storage persistence for game saves and player accounts

## Build Commands
- **Serve development server**: `npm run serve` (Python HTTP server on port 9999)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build` (Webpack bundling to dist/)

## Performance Monitoring
- **modules/performance-monitor.js**: Real-time performance tracking

- **Features**: FPS monitoring, memory usage, load time tracking
- **Console access**: Use `perfMonitor.toggle()` to show/hide overlay
- **Methods**: `perfMonitor.getMetrics()`, `perfMonitor.logMetrics()`

## Code Style Guidelines

### Imports & Modules
- Use ES6 modules with explicit imports at the top of files
- Group imports by category: core/, modules/, data/
- Import specific functions/objects, not entire modules
- Example: `import { getRandomInt, deepClone } from './utilities.js'`

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `playerCredits`, `calculateDistance`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for exported constants
- **Files**: kebab-case for modules, camelCase for core files
- Use descriptive, meaningful names

### Formatting
- 4-space indentation
- No semicolons at end of statements
- Single quotes for strings
- Consistent spacing around operators and commas

### Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for risky operations
- Display user-friendly error messages via `displayConsoleMessage()`
- Validate inputs and handle edge cases
- Return early from functions on error conditions

### Code Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use clear section comments for major code blocks
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate

### Performance
- Use efficient algorithms for game calculations
- Cache expensive operations when possible
- Monitor performance with the performance-monitor module

## Project Structure & File Purposes

### Core Files (`core/`)

**main.js** - Main entry point that orchestrates ES6 module loading and initialization. Imports all core modules, data files, and sets up the application structure. Serves as the central hub for module coordination during the ES6 migration from legacy script loading.

**state.js** - Centralized game state management containing all global game objects. Defines the `game` object (player data, map, NPCs, ports, planets) and `ui` object (DOM element references). Acts as the single source of truth for game state across all modules.

**game.js** - Handles game lifecycle operations including initialization, saving/loading game state to localStorage, and restarting functionality. Manages player creation, game setup, and persistence of player accounts and game sessions.

**utilities.js** - Core utility functions used throughout the application. Contains random number generation, deep object cloning, array manipulation helpers, and other common utility functions that don't fit in specific feature modules.

**movement.js** - Manages all player movement and navigation logic. Handles sector transitions, movement validation, solar array deployment/retraction, and simulation mode for automated gameplay. Processes movement commands and updates player position.

**actions.js** - Contains player action handlers for game mechanics. Processes commands like scanning sectors, deploying equipment (mines, fighters), interacting with ports, and other player-initiated actions that affect the game world.

**npc.js** - Manages NPC (Non-Player Character) ship generation, AI behavior, and movement patterns. Creates NPC ships with different archetypes, handles their autonomous movement around the galaxy, profitable trading (buy-low-sell-high with +3-4M credits net), equipment upgrades (40-60% success rates), fuel management, and faction-specific strategic decision-making. NPCs prioritize selling all available inventory for space, then buying cheap commodities to arbitrage at better ports.

**events.js** - Sets up DOM event listeners and keyboard event handling. Manages all user interface interactions, button clicks, keyboard shortcuts, and event delegation. Initializes the UI and performance monitoring on page load.

### Modules (`modules/`)

**ui.js** - User interface management and display updates. Handles console message system with timestamps and message types, UI state updates, manual display, galaxy log viewing, and all visual feedback to the player.

**audio.js** - Sound effects and background music control. Manages audio initialization, volume controls, music theme selection, sound effect playback, and handles browser audio restrictions (requiring user interaction before playing audio).

**auth.js** - Player authentication and account management. Handles login/logout functionality, player account creation, session management, and the authentication modal system for managing multiple player accounts.

**commerce.js** - Trading system and port interactions. Manages buy/sell transactions for commodities (ore/food/tech) and exotic resources (minerals/organics/artifacts), handles port ownership mechanics, calculates trade profits/losses, processes player-owned port benefits, and supports NPC automated trading. Features dynamic port prices with boom/bust events and price clamps ensuring profitable trading (sell prices â‰¤ buy prices).

**combat.js** - Combat mechanics and ship-to-ship battles. Handles combat initiation, damage calculations, shield/hull interactions, weapon systems (fighters, missiles, mines), and combat UI state management.

**economy.js** - Economic events and market dynamics. Manages random economic events like booms, busts, strikes, and shortages that affect commodity prices across the galaxy. Creates dynamic market fluctuations.

**factions.js** - Faction relationships and diplomatic systems. Manages the three main factions (Traders, Duran, Vinari), their territories, ships, relationships, and generates faction-related events and conflicts.

**galactic-bank.js** - Banking system for players and NPCs. Handles deposits, withdrawals, interest calculations (1.5% daily), PIN security, and persistent account storage. NPCs use banking for wealth management and long-term credit accumulation.

**lottery.js** - Lottery system for random rewards. Implements a number-drawing lottery game where players can win credits. Manages lottery state, number selection, drawing mechanics, and periodic play resets.

**mechanics.js** - Core game mechanics implementation. Handles hazard encounters (mines, asteroids), damage calculations from environmental hazards, sector scanning results, and various game world interactions.

**planets.js** - Planet generation and colonization features. Creates procedural planets with different types, atmospheres, temperatures, and life signs. Generates descriptive text for planet exploration, colonization mechanics, and NPC mining operations with resource extraction.
